# Interview Scheduler
### Meet Interview Scheduler, a sleek and modern client application that utilizes the power of the React view library to streamline the scheduling process. Built as a single page application (SPA), Interview Scheduler is designed for ease of use and efficiency. Data is securely persisted by the API server using a robust PostgreSQL database, while the client communicates seamlessly with the server over HTTP using the JSON format.
